		<h1>Project 2 Checkpoint 1</h1>
		<main>
		<h2>Stationery Shop</h2>
		<p>My first idea is to make a website that sells different stationery items. Some of the products include notebooks, pens, paper, and office supplies.</p>
		<h2>Streetwear/Clothing Brand</h2>
		<p>My second idea is to make a site that sells different clothing items with artwork on them. The products would include t-shirts, sweatshirts, bags, and other miscellaneous clothing items.</p>
		<h2>Artist Website</h2>
		<p>My third idea is to make a website for a fictional artist who sells prints and other products with their art on it. Some of the products would include prints, stickers, and keychains.</p>
