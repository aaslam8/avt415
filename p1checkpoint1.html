		<h1>Project 1 Checkpoint 1</h1>
		<main>
		<h2>Designing the Washington Metro Wayfinding System</h2>
		<p>My first idea is to make a website that explains how the Washington Metro’s wayfinding system and visual look was developed, as well as the people who helped create it. I’ll also show the multiple iterations it went through until the present. The overall aesthetic of the site would resemble that of the wayfinding system.</p>
		<h2>History of the Animal Crossing Games</h2>
		<p>My second idea is to make a site that shows the history of all the Animal Crossing games released since the first game. It would be structured like a timeline and also have plenty of images.</p>
		<h2>How Different Espresso Drinks Are Made</h2>
		<p>My third idea is to make a website that shows how popular espresso drinks are made (milk to coffee ratio, preparation, etc.)</p>
